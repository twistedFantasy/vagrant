## Overview

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is an open-source software product for building and maintaining portable virtual software 
development environments, e.g. for VirtualBox, KVM, Hyper-V, Docker containers, VMware, and AWS.
It tries to simplify software configuration management of virtualizations in order to increase development productivity. Vagrant is written in the Ruby language, but its ecosystem supports development in a few languages.
